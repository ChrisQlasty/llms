Prepare the rice: Ideally, use day-old rice as it's firmer and less sticky. If you only have freshly cooked rice, spread it on a plate to cool and dry slightly. (This helps prevent the rice from becoming mushy).\n","2. Prepare the other ingredients: Finely chop the green onions.  Whisk the eggs lightly with a pinch of salt. (Consider adding other vegetables like diced carrots, peas, or chopped bell peppers for extra flavor and nutrients).\n","3. Heat the oil: Heat a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil. (Vegetable or peanut oil works well).\n","4. Scramble the eggs: Add the whisked eggs to the hot pan and scramble them until they are cooked but still slightly moist. Remove the eggs from the pan and set aside.\n","5. Stir-fry the rice: Add the rice to the pan and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until heated through. Break up any clumps.\n","6. Add the green onions: Add the chopped green onions and stir-fry for another minute.\n","7. Combine and finish: Return the scrambled eggs to the pan and gently mix everything together. Season with soy sauce to taste. (A dash of sesame oil adds a lovely aroma).\n","8. Serve immediately: Serve hot as a main course or side dish.\n","\n","\n","**Ingredients chef already has:**\n","\n","* Rice\n","\n","\n","**Ingredients missing:**\n","\n","* Eggs\n","* Green onions\n","* Oil (vegetable or peanut)\n","* Soy sauce\n","(Sesame oil - optional)\n","\n","\n","Shall I add these to your order?\n","User: Please, order missing ingredients.\n","Model: Great.

Add 2 tablespoons of oil. (Vegetable or peanut oil works well).\\n4. Scramble the eggs: Add the whisked eggs to the hot pan and scramble them until they are cooked but still slightly moist. Remove the eggs from the pan and set aside.\\n5. Stir-fry the rice: Add the rice to the pan and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until heated through. Break up any clumps.\\n6. Add the green onions: Add the chopped green onions and stir-fry for another minute.\\n7. Combine and finish: Return the scrambled eggs to the pan and gently mix everything together.
