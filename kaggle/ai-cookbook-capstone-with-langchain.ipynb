Make  eggs  thread by beating them with a tablespoonful of  water,  then pour through a sieve into boiling  water  and use as a garnish.            OMELETTES     FOO TAY D&#196;N (Chinese Ham and Eggs)  Six  eggs;  one tablespoonful of  ham fat;  one half cup of minced  ham;  one half dozen  water chestnuts;\\nPASSAGE:   There is no reason why these same dishes should not be cooked and served in any American home. When it is known how simple and clean are the ingredients used to make up these Oriental dishes, the Westerner will cease to feel that natural repugnance which assails one when about to taste a strange dish of a new and strange land.       Bread, butter, and potatoes are never used by the Chinese or Japanese. Tea is drunk plain, with neither cream nor sugar, but great care should be used in its brewing. Rice is indispensable, and should be cooked in that peculiarly delectable fashion of which the Oriental peoples alone are past masters. The secret of the solid, flaky, almost dry, yet thoroughly cooked rice lies in the fact that it is never boiled more than thirty minutes, is covered twenty minutes, never stirred nor disturbed, and set to dry on back of range when cooked, covered with a cloth. Mushy, wet, slimy, overcooked rice is unknown to the Chinese and Japanese. Sweetened rice, as in rice pudding and similar dishes, is unknown. Rice takes the place of such staples as bread and potatoes. Syou, sometimes called Soye, is similar to Worcestershire and similar European sauces. In fact, the latter are all said to be adaptations of the original Chinese syou, and most of these European sauces contain     syou in their makeup. It lends a flavor to any meat dish, and is greatly esteemed by the Oriental peoples.  In China, with the exception of rice, bonbons, and so on, food is served in one large dish or bowl, out of which all eat, using the chop-sticks. Considerable etiquette governs the manner of picking desired morsels from the main bowls. In high-caste or mandarin families a servant has his place at the foot of the table, but he stands throughout the meal. It is his duty to serve at the table the portions from the main dishes to each individual, and to do what the host generally does for the comfort of those at table. The other servants waiting on table take their orders from him, and he is really there as a sort of proxy for the host.  In Japan, individual meals are brought in on separate trays to each person. All sit cross-legged upon the floor before their trays. The Japanese consider it gross and vulgar to put     food in quantity upon the plate. The portions are very\\nPASSAGE:  and rinsed thoroughly.  Care must be taken to measure accurately the ingredients of recipes, for the spices and relishes used in Chinese kitchens are exceedingly hot and pronounced in flavor.  To make rich stock for soup use     only a quart of water to every pound of veal, mutton, or beef bone.  To determine whether a fish is fresh, watch that its flesh is firm and thick, its scales glistening, and its eyes prominent.  When dropped into a bowl or pan containing cold water, eggs that are absolutely fresh will immediately sink to the bottom and rest there; eggs which are not perfectly fresh will stand on end or rise a little.  Delicious dishes can be obtained only from the use of the purest and best quality of ingredients. A good cook needs to be as well a discriminating purchaser.  Glass measures recording pints and quarts of liquid and ounces and pounds of solids (like sugar), with the fractions thereof, are handy and sanitary.        TO BOIL RICE  Use an iron pot. Wash the  rice  thoroughly in many waters, until, in fact, the  water  is as clear as for drinking. To one cupful of  rice  add     one and a quarter cupfuls of  cold water.  Cover tight, and boil slowly half an hour--no more. On no account stir.  Rice  should not be disturbed till it is taken up; that is the secret of the dry, finely cooked Chinese  rice.  Set on back of range, covered with a clean cloth or napkin, until ready to serve.  Rice  should be served in individual bowls, replenished as soon as empty throughout the meal. With the Chinese it takes the place of bread or potatoes.  Salt  is not added until it is served.          TEA  The quantity of  tea  used depends on the quality, and the taste of the individual. Rinse the pot with boiling  water  before putting in the  tea.  The  water  should just come to a boil--no more. Pour on the  tea leaves.  Let it stand for two or three minutes, but on no account must it be allowed to boil. Strain  tea  from leaves, and serve pure, if Chinese  tea  is used. See more about  tea  on page 109.              SOUPS     YEA FOO MAIN\\nPASSAGE:  forming a layer at the bottom of the dish, and place the vegetables and  gravy  on top of the noodles. Add a layer of the shredded  chicken breast,  lastly the  yolks of hard-boiled eggs,  crumbled, as a garnish. Serve very hot.      LOBSTER CHOW MAIN  One pound of  lobster meat;  two  eggs;  one half pound of  noodles;  three stalks of  celery;  one can of  bamboo shoots;  one  onion;  one quarter pound of  mushrooms;  one tablespoonful of  sweet lard;  one quart of  peanut oil;  three  water chestnuts.   First boil the  peanut oil  and into it throw the noodles, cooking until crisp. Remove and drain, while preparing following: Put teaspoon of  sweet lard  into frying pan, and when hot turn in half the  lobster meat,  which has previously been cooked. (Canned      lobster  will do as well.) Cook for a few minutes, then add the  onion,   mushrooms,  and  water chestnuts.  The bamboo shoots are added last, and all fried for ten minutes. Take a hot platter, and place the crisp noodles as a layer at the bottom of the dish, and spread above ingredients on top. Then take the other half of the  lobster meat,  and place a layer on top. Garnish with shredded  yolks of hard-boiled eggs.

      "PASSAGE:   There is no reason why these same dishes should not be cooked and served in any American home. When it is known how simple and clean are the ingredients used to make up these Oriental dishes, the Westerner will cease to feel that natural repugnance which assails one when about to taste a strange dish of a new and strange land.       Bread, butter, and potatoes are never used by the Chinese or Japanese. Tea is drunk plain, with neither cream nor sugar, but great care should be used in its brewing. Rice is indispensable, and should be cooked in that peculiarly delectable fashion of which the Oriental peoples alone are past masters. The secret of the solid, flaky, almost dry, yet thoroughly cooked rice lies in the fact that it is never boiled more than thirty minutes, is covered twenty minutes, never stirred nor disturbed, and set to dry on back of range when cooked, covered with a cloth. Mushy, wet, slimy, overcooked rice is unknown to the Chinese and Japanese. Sweetened rice, as in rice pudding and similar dishes, is unknown. Rice takes the place of such staples as bread and potatoes. Syou, sometimes called Soye, is similar to Worcestershire and similar European sauces. In fact, the latter are all said to be adaptations of the original Chinese syou, and most of these European sauces contain     syou in their makeup. It lends a flavor to any meat dish, and is greatly esteemed by the Oriental peoples.  In China, with the exception of rice, bonbons, and so on, food is served in one large dish or bowl, out of which all eat, using the chop-sticks. Considerable etiquette governs the manner of picking desired morsels from the main bowls. In high-caste or mandarin families a servant has his place at the foot of the table, but he stands throughout the meal. It is his duty to serve at the table the portions from the main dishes to each individual, and to do what the host generally does for the comfort of those at table. The other servants waiting on table take their orders from him, and he is really there as a sort of proxy for the host.  In Japan, individual meals are brought in on separate trays to each person. All sit cross-legged upon the floor before their trays. The Japanese consider it gross and vulgar to put     food in quantity upon the plate. The portions are very\n",
      "PASSAGE:  and rinsed thoroughly.  Care must be taken to measure accurately the ingredients of recipes, for the spices and relishes used in Chinese kitchens are exceedingly hot and pronounced in flavor.  To make rich stock for soup use     only a quart of water to every pound of veal, mutton, or beef bone.  To determine whether a fish is fresh, watch that its flesh is firm and thick, its scales glistening, and its eyes prominent.  When dropped into a bowl or pan containing cold water, eggs that are absolutely fresh will immediately sink to the bottom and rest there; eggs which are not perfectly fresh will stand on end or rise a little.  Delicious dishes can be obtained only from the use of the purest and best quality of ingredients. A good cook needs to be as well a discriminating purchaser.  Glass measures recording pints and quarts of liquid and ounces and pounds of solids (like sugar), with the fractions thereof, are handy and sanitary.        TO BOIL RICE  Use an iron pot. Wash the  rice  thoroughly in many waters, until, in fact, the  water  is as clear as for drinking. To one cupful of  rice  add     one and a quarter cupfuls of  cold water.  Cover tight, and boil slowly half an hour--no more. On no account stir.  Rice  should not be disturbed till it is taken up; that is the secret of the dry, finely cooked Chinese  rice.  Set on back of range, covered with a clean cloth or napkin, until ready to serve.  Rice  should be served in individual bowls, replenished as soon as empty throughout the meal. With the Chinese it takes the place of bread or potatoes.  Salt  is not added until it is served.          TEA  The quantity of  tea  used depends on the quality, and the taste of the individual. Rinse the pot with boiling  water  before putting in the  tea.  The  water  should just come to a boil--no more. Pour on the  tea leaves.  Let it stand for two or three minutes, but on no account must it be allowed to boil. Strain  tea  from leaves, and serve pure, if Chinese  tea  is used. See more about  tea  on page 109.
